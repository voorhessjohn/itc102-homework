DEF CON 22 - Metacortex and Grifter - Touring the Darkside of the Internet. An Introduction to Tor

Thoughts:
---------
One-hundred words is tough.  The speakers do great service to 'shed light' on Tor and it's use for anonymity.  Of particular interest to me was the concept pf creating additional layers of security with false documents and shipping depots.  

While this video appeals to those who already understand the value of anonymity, I think that focusing on developing countries and authoritarian regimes while allowing viewers to draw parallels to their own governments may be an effective means of presenting this information in the future.  Essentially, there was plenty of 'How?', but they left out some of the 'Why?'
