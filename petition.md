[A petition to legalize lane-splitting by motorcycles.](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov//petition/make-it-legal-all-motorcyclists-within-united-states-america-split-lanes-httpsgoogl2t2vul)

Lane splitting in California is a sort-of grandfathered policy that was originally intended to allow air-cooled motorcycles to move through stopped traffic avoided the possibility of overheating.  The legality has remained in place while motorcycle technology has shifted to liquid-cooling which, under normal conditions, would allow motorcycles to idle indefinitely.

By allowing lane splitting, California's traffic infrastructure can handle greater numbers of travelers without additional investment of public funds.  Additionally, emergency services in places like California and Japan have adapted motorcycles to respond faster than traditional 4+ wheeled emergency vehicles to disabled vehicles and other traffic emergencies by splitting lanes through slowed traffic.

[According to the EPA, average fuel efficiency for model year 2014 vehicles sold in the US is just over 24 miles per gallon.](https://www3.epa.gov/fueleconomy/fetrends/1975-2014/420s14001.pdf)  Lighter, modern motorcycles are more fuel efficient than cars.  For example, my current motorcycle (a 3000 dollar used Honda) is a fairly inefficient model that returns an average of 38mpg in the city and 48mpg on the interstate. My previous 2000 dollar Kawasaki could hit 62mpg all day long. 

It just doesn't make sense to me for single occupants to commute in an empty 5-seater car.

I believe that encouraging single-occupant vehicle drivers to switch to significantly more fuel efficient 2-wheeled vehicles with the benefit of cutting through traffic would reduce overall congestion on the road and reduce petroleum consumption as an added, secondary benefit.
