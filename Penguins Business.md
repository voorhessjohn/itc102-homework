Magellan Tech Consultants:
--------------------------
**The Penguins New Business.**

* **Main Idea:** A development and design firm whose initial product is tech support geared toward the elderly (Including a screen-sharing technology for remote access to customer electronics).

* **Tiered service access:** 

 1. Phone service
 2. Phone service PLUS remote access 
 3. In-home visits 

* **Market**: Both arketed directly to the elderly and as a subscription service that can be purchased by their families, and to grandkids who might buy it as a holiday gift.

**Shout-out to our team members!**
* **John:** came up with the original idea, splitting service into tiers, and marketing strategy (and hosted this repo!).
* **Ruth:** added ideas based on her tech-support background: "the tricky is they don't necesarily know what their problem is. it starts out as one problem but turns out to be another because they didnt know how to describe it.  I think offering basic tech support helps them feel more confident in future problem solving because they can at least use better vocab."
* **Tom:** added a great marketing angle: "home visits are more personal  than a phone call...[we can] use that as a selling point"
* **Sophia:** contributed business name ideas, and that we'd need to simplify our screen sharing app: "If we're dealing with people that don't know how to use a search bar, they aren't going to have an easy time using screen sharing."
* **Andre:** helped come up with the business name, and contributed to the screen sharing app idea: "consulting [only] through phone kinda hard for old people ... their knowledge about phone is little."
