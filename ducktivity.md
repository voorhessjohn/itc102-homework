 - When the user get to locations by the specified time they are awarded points.
 - Points can be redeemed for goods, services from advertisers who get user behavior data in exchange. 
 - Rewards come in form of digital “coupons” that will be used depending on the merchandise or service. 
 - "Sponsored" events could feature bigger rewards with incentives to sign up early for an event using the app.
 - Overall usage would be geared toward people who like to plan
   their lives and/or want to be held accountable for punctuality.
